# Change Log

These versions follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org).

## 1.1.0 (2023-05-28)

This version mainly introduces support for `--show-error-end` and `--show-error-codes`
optionsâ€”they become the default but not mandatory. The inverse options are supported as
well, so the extension stays backward-compatible.
